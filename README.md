## Project Description
This project is the development of a website application that provides you with lyrics to all genres of music.
The idea is to provide entertainment to the user.
The Project was done for the purpose of learning and to grasp hands-on skills in website application development and interaction with a public application programming interface as part of my Software Engineering journey.


#### Landing Page

## Technology Used
This was achieved through the use of 2 Public API's and one custom made JSON server.
The two public API's used are:
- [lyrics-ovh](https://api.lyrics.ovh)
- [hoppscotch](https://echo.hoppscotch.io)

However, each of the two seems to have a certain drawback, as sometimes the first one fails while the latter is limited per the number of requests one can GET per given time.

- `Music Life` application was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
This work has been deployed on both GitHub and Heroku and can thus be viewed using this live link: https://sean-code.github.io/Project/
